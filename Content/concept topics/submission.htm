            <MadCap:keyword term="Submission" />Submission</h2>
        <p>BCS  electronically tracks quote and policy application submissions submitted by an agency. It prevents quoting an identical submissions multiples times if you receive the same submissions from different agencies.</p>
        <p>When you clear an submission, BCS associates the client name and client ID with that submission. This also creates a history of application submissions for clients with whom you write insurance coverage and for those where coverage was never issued.</p>
        <h3>Submission versus Application</h3>
        <p>In BCS, an application is a collection of submissions. Individual submissions are grouped with other submissions to form an application. For example, when you start the process of creating a submission, you create the application information first. This information consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The client address</li>
            <li>An application type</li>
            <li>Effective date</li>
            <li>Agency and agent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The next step of the process is where you create the actual submission by entering such things as the underwriting unit and line of business. When you submit it, BCS creates an application and groups the submission or submissions you created in the newly created application. You can also add new submissions to existing applications.</p>
        <h3>Edit Submission</h3>
        <p>You can edit an existing submission. Click on the Edit button to make the fields active.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">BCS displays a warning message if the agency associated with the submission has been referred to another agency. You can update the agency information from the warning.</p>
        <h3>Policy Numbers<MadCap:keyword term="Policy Numbers" /></h3>
        <p>BCS includes functionality to generate a policy number that you can use when you issue a policy from your policy issuance system. BCS manages those policy numbers behind the scenes, and when you request a policy number through the policy number generator function, BCS automatically selects the next available policy number and assigns it to the current application submission.</p>
        <p>You can also add a policy number manually to a submission.</p>
        <h3>Submission Status<MadCap:keyword term="Submission Status" /></h3>
        <p>The submission status displays in the upper-portion of the page. Click on the status to view the status history for the submission. The pop up window displays the current status, date the status changed, and who changed the status. It also displays any notes added during the status update.</p>
        <p>You can reverse the status of a submission. For example, if you accidentally changed the status from pending to rated, you can reverse the status change back to pending. The Update Status menu contains a Reverse Status item. When you select it, the Reverse Status window displays. You will be able to select a status that you want to revert the submission to. If the list displays several status changes, you can select the status you want to revert to from the list.</p>
        <p>If you select either Missed Quote or Declined from the Status Reason list, BCS requires you to also select a reason from the Reason list.</p>
        <h3>Copy Submission<MadCap:keyword term="Copy Submission" /></h3>
        <p>You can copy the information from one submission to a new submission in BCS. This allows you to reuse the current submission setup for a client without having to re-enter information into the new submission.</p>
